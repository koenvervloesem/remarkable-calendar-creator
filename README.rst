This tool creates calendars to display on a reMarkable device. You can create:

- a PNG image to use instead of the default suspend screen (in ``/usr/share/remarkable/suspended.png``)
- a PDF document to write your notes on

************
Requirements
************

The reMarkable Calendar Creator is essentially a light wrapper around `pcal <http://pcal.sourceforge.net/>`_ (which generates calendars in PostScript output) and `GhostScript <https://www.ghostscript.com/>`_ (to convert the PostScript to PNG or PDF). Both programs are available in all major Linux distributions. For instance on Ubuntu you can install them as:

.. code-block:: console

  $ sudo apt install pcal ghostscript

You can also install both programs on your reMarkable, after you have installed `Toltec <https://toltec-dev.org/>`_:

.. code-block:: console

  reMarkable: ~/ opkg install pcal ghostscript

*******************************
Installation on your reMarkable
*******************************

You can just run the shell script as ``remarkable-calendar-creator.sh``, or you can install this on your reMarkable from source:

.. code-block:: console

  reMarkable: ~/ git clone https://github.com/koenvervloesem/remarkable-calendar-creator.git
  reMarkable: ~/ make install

This installs the binary in ``/opt/bin``, as well as a systemd script and timer that replaces your splash screen ``/usr/share/remarkable/suspended.png`` every day with a calendar. If you want to change the type of calendar, change the environment variables in ``/opt/etc/remarkable-calendar-creator/remarkable-calendar-creator.env``.

.. note::

  The ``make install`` command makes a backup of your original splash screen in ``/opt/etc/remarkable-calendar-creator/suspended.png.backup``.

*****
Usage
*****

You can create a calendar of the current month, for instance as a PNG image:

.. code-block:: console

  $ remarkable-calendar-creator calendar.png

Or a calendar with all months of the current year on one sheet in a PNG file:

.. code-block:: console

  $ remarkable-calendar-creator calendar.png -w

Or you can create a PDF with a page for every monthly calendar of 2021:

.. code-block:: console

  $ remarkable-calendar-creator calendar.pdf 2021

You can find the result of the above three commands in May 2021 in the examples directory.

*************
Configuration
*************

You can find the default configuration for pcal and GhostScript in ``remarkable-calendar-creator.env``. If you want to override this configuration, export particular environment variables. Moreover, every argument for ``remarkable-calendar-creator`` that you add after the filename is forwarded to ``pcal``.

Especially pcal has a lot of possible customizations. For instance you can add moon phases or custom images. You can even include a data file with events shown on the calendar, such as holidays or birthdays. Have a look at ``man pcal`` for all possibilities.
